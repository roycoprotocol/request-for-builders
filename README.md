# Request for Builders

A series of exciting applications that can be built on Royco. 

### 1. Decentralized market making

Build a hyper-specialized interface for incentivizing AMM pools. Run an auction similar to the current market-making platforms to identify the best participant. But allow anyone to participate and compete in real time. 

### 2. Custom strategy allocator

Build a layer where users can build or opt-in to yield strategies. 

Allow users to create "buckets," a user-specified list of markets. These buckets are created to optimize a user's yield, actively rebalancing for the highest yield. The rebalancer is done trustlessly and verified through an onchain merkle root. It is paid through a piece of the yield earned.

Users may create their buckets or opt-in to others' buckets. 

### 3. Unstoppable interface

Build an interface for Royco on IPFS that cannot be stopped.

### 4. Grant matcher

Build a system where folks (like Gitcoin) can do match grants in the most market-efficient way. 

### 7. Chain-powered liquidity
